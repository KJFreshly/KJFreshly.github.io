Final Project for cs50

For my final project, I wanted to work on something that accomplishes something that is simple, but also practical. I also wanted to push myself to get my hands dirty with an API and get used to reading documentation and learning a set of tools in a short period of time.

EatSheet takes a location, some user input, and will recommend you a place to eat based on your criteria. It makes heavy use of the Google Maps API, while also being a one-page app that is dynamic and responsive.
